# Openintro_in_Python
Python codes for the Openintro labs in R (https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php?stat_lab_software=R)

# 1. Hot-hand player vs. Cold-hand player 
* Exploring the differences of hot-hand player and cold-hand player through the lens of graphical description and numberical statistical summary
* Motivated by the excercise "Is Kobe Bryant a hot-hand basketball player?", from the openintro website (https://www.openintro.org/download.php?file=os2_lab_02A)

# 2. The normal distribution
* The Python code for solving the 3rd lab session of Openintro, 'The normal distribution' (http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrewpbray/oiLabs-base-R/blob/master/normal_distribution/normal_distribution.html) 
* Deciding whether data is coming from the normally distributed population by using the Q-Q plot
* The professor of the Wharton school, Upenn wrote a great paper to explain the concepts of the Q-Q plots

* Calculating the probability in the normal distribution
* Using Matplotlib's subplot function and seaborn to draw several plots side by side

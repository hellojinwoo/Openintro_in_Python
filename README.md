# Openintro_in_Python
Python codes for the <a href="https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php?stat_lab_software=R">Openintro labs in R</a> 

# 1. Hot-hand player vs. Cold-hand player 
* Exploring the differences of hot-hand player and cold-hand player through the lens of graphical description and numberical statistical summary
* Motivated by the 2nd lab session, "<a href="https://www.openintro.org/download.php?file=os2_lab_02A">Probability</a>, which deals with the question, "Is Kobe Bryant a hot-hand basketball player?"

# 2. The normal distribution
* The Python code for solving the 3rd lab session, <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrewpbray/oiLabs-base-R/blob/master/normal_distribution/normal_distribution.html"> 'The normal distribution' </a>
* Deciding whether data is coming from the normally distributed population by using the Q-Q plot
* The professor of the Wharton school, Upenn wrote a great paper to explain the concepts of the Q-Q plots, <a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~stine/shiny/quantile_plot.pdf">'*Explaining Normal Quantile-Quantile Plots through Animation: The Water-Filling Analogy*</a>.
* Calculating the probability in the normal distribution
* Using Matplotlib's subplot function and seaborn to draw several plots side by side
